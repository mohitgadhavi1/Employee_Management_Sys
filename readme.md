 ***SOME FEATURES YET TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE PROJECT *** 
 
To execute the application locally, follow these steps:

Navigate to the server Folder.
Refer to the env.example file and make the necessary adjustments.
Initially, execute the script in the sandbox directory (optional but recommended for updating the department and employee lists in the database).
Run the command nodemon app.js (ensure that nodemon is installed).
This sequence ensures a smooth setup for running the application on your local machine.


On the frontend, I've Used React, Redux, React Router, and Tailwind CSS. 
 on the backend, I've implemented Node.js and Express, with MongoDB serving as the chosen database.
